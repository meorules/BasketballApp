# BasketballApp
This is a repository for the Basketball Data Collection Mobile App known as Dunk Analytics. 

The application was developed using Xamarin Forms and therefore should be compatible with both IOS & Android, however it was only tested on an Android. 
Additionally, it may not exactly work on some androids due to the use of elicit screen sizes for a few of the pages (which is something which may be addressed in a later update)
However, it does work on a Samsung Phone S22 Ultra, but attempts to run a device such as that on my machine have failed and therefore I was only able to run it
on my physical device. 
For reference, an S22 Ultra has dimensions of 1440 x 3088 (~500 ppi density) and my device was running on Android 13. 

To run the Unit Tests, the C# testing framework needs to be installed and then the tests can be run simply by using the Test Explorer.
